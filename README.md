## üìù Overview

SynCrypt is a polymorphic encryption and obfuscation tool for red team payload delivery, C2 channel evasion, and blue team detection research. It combines custom block cipher logic, junk-masked output, and unpredictable encoding formats to defeat static, signature, and entropy-based detection.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Seed & Nonce Generation:** Random 32-byte seed and 16-byte nonce for each encryption
2. **Junk Masking:** After every 2 real characters, 1 random alphanumeric junk character is inserted
3. **Multiple Encoding Formats:** Each byte is encoded using one of five unpredictable formats
4. **Encryption:** Plaintext is encrypted with a custom S-box and encoding map, then masked
5. **Decryption:** Header and ciphertext are unmasked, S-box and map are regenerated, and plaintext is recovered

---

syncrypt.exe

## üöÄ Quick Start

```sh
# Build
gcc -o syncrypt.exe syncrypt_tool.c syncrypt.c

# Run
syncrypt.exe
```


- **C2 Channels:** Obfuscated output can be tunneled through text-based protocols
- **Payload Staging:** Small, self-contained headers and output are ideal for staged payloads or loader beacons
- **Bypassing DLP/IDS:** Junk-masked output can bypass naive DLP/IDS rules
- **Chaining:** Combine with steganography, protocol tunneling, or other obfuscation for layered evasion


## üî¨ Blue Team/Detection Research

- **Detection Challenges:**
  - Junk-masked output breaks simple regex, YARA, and entropy-based rules
  - Polymorphic output means no two encryptions are alike
  - Multiple encoding formats defeat fixed-pattern matching
- **Detection Opportunities:**
  - Look for repeated patterns of alphanumeric junk (2 real, 1 junk)
  - Use statistical analysis to spot non-natural character distributions
- **Reverse Engineering:**
  - Blue teams can reconstruct the S-box/map if the seed+nonce and key are recovered
  - Junk removal is deterministic if the pattern is known (2 real, 1 junk)

## Detection Evasion & Limitations**Q: What if I lose the header or key?**

- **Strengths:**- Decryption is impossible without both the correct key and the exact header (seed+nonce).

  - Defeats static, signature, and entropy-based detection.

  - Polymorphic output and junk masking make pattern matching difficult.---

  - Multiple encoding formats further complicate detection.

- **Limitations:**## Additional Red Team/Blue Team Research Notes

  - Not cryptographically secure for protecting sensitive data.

  - Behavioral and contextual analysis can still reveal usage.### Red Team

  - If header and key are recovered, decryption is possible.- **Bypass Techniques:**

  - Use SynCrypt to wrap payloads, C2 beacons, or loader stagers to evade static and entropy-based detection.

---  - Chain with other obfuscation (e.g., steganography, protocol tunneling) for layered evasion.

- **Operational Security:**

## YARA/Regex Detection Examples  - Rotate keys and never reuse headers between operations.

**Regex for all formats:**  - Use ephemeral keys for one-time payloads.

```

### Red Team Use Cases
- **Payload Evasion:** SynCrypt's polymorphic, junk-masked output can evade YARA, regex, and static pattern-based detection.
- **C2 Channels:** Obfuscated output can be tunneled through text-based protocols, blending with noisy traffic.
- **Payload Staging:** Small, self-contained headers and output are ideal for staged payloads or loader beacons.
- **Bypassing DLP/IDS:** Junk-masked output can bypass naive DLP/IDS rules that expect base64 or hex.

### Blue Team/Detection Research
- **Detection Challenges:**
  - Junk-masked output breaks simple regex, YARA, and entropy-based rules.
  - Polymorphic output means no two encryptions are alike, complicating hash- or signature-based detection.
- **Detection Opportunities:**
  - Look for repeated patterns of alphanumeric junk (e.g., 2 real, 1 junk) in traffic or files.
  - Use statistical analysis to spot non-natural character distributions.
  - Monitor for the presence of the tool or its CLI artifacts (e.g., `enc.log`).
- **Reverse Engineering:**
  - Blue teams can reconstruct the S-box/map if the seed+nonce and key are recovered.
  - Junk removal is deterministic if the pattern is known (2 real, 1 junk).

## Professional Documentation Notes
- **Red Team:** SynCrypt is ideal for research, payload delivery, and C2 obfuscation where custom, non-standard encryption is needed. It is not a replacement for strong cryptography in high-assurance environments.
- **Blue Team:** Focus on behavioral, statistical, and tool artifact detection. Consider instrumenting endpoints to monitor for custom CLI tools and junk-masked output patterns.
- **Research:** SynCrypt is a demonstration of how polymorphism and junk masking can defeat naive detection, but is not a substitute for cryptographically secure, peer-reviewed algorithms for data at rest or in transit.
